# digital-clock


This project is a Digital Clock application created using React and Vite. 
The clock displays real-time time and allows users to choose which time zone they want to display (e.g., local time, UTC, or any other time zone). 
This project was developed to learn how to work with React components, manage state, and use JavaScript's Date API to handle time.
